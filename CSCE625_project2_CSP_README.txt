The following program was done using constraint programming in PythonIDLE(32 bit).
To use the constraint operations, constraint class was imported into the python library.
All the constraints mentioned in the design problem have been satisfied using the constraint operations and I have included my input files and output files in the submission too.

However, the mapping for the sample files posted by the professor could not be satisfied as 1 pilot can be assigned a maximum of 3 missions and each pilot is assigned a maximum of 1 UAV and the sample file violated the very norm.

There are a total of 3 input test cases and 3 output files which satisfied the constraints.
